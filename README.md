# HRnet

![HRnet](public/readMe/logo.svg)

_**HRnet**_ is an internal web application of the __Wealth Health__ company. The goal here was to move from a [jQuery application](https://github.com/Roy-Framery-s-Openclassrooms-projects/oldHRnet) to a React application. Four jQuery plugins was present in the initial application : 
- [jQuery DateTimePicker](https://github.com/xdan/datetimepicker)
- [jQuery Select](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/main/ui/widgets/selectmenu.js)
- [jQuery DataTables](https://github.com/DataTables/DataTables)
- [jQuery Modal](https://github.com/kylefox/jquery-modal)

All of them had to be replaced by a __React__ component :
- [react-table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-table)
- [react-datepicker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-datepicker)
- [select](https://github.com/Roy-Framery-s-Openclassrooms-projects/royframery_14_18042022/blob/dev/src/components/Select/index.jsx) : For the select, we created a basic react component which could be improve in the future;
- [@royframery_openclassrooms/modal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@royframery_openclassrooms/modal) : We created our own modal library which is at its first version.
